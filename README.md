¬Heya, @M-Pues here, a normal guy who wants to get into this world
¬I’m currently learning:
 - English
 - Programming Fundamentals
 - Programming Languages Paradigms
 - Logic, Algorithms and Data Structures
 
~Then I'll continue to learn:
 - C++, C#, and JavaScript programming languages
 - SQL and Data Bases
   And more!

 ~ Mostly, I'm interesting in Software Development and... Videogame Development (yeah...)

I still gotta get to it in Git/GitHub and stuff so I can work on something
